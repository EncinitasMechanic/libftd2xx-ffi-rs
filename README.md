# libftd2xx-ffi

Rust FFI bindings to the [FTDI D2XX drivers].

This crate is **just** the C bindings.
There is a separate crate, [libftd2xx], which provides safe wrappers around
the unsafe C bindings.

## Usage
Simply add this crate as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`.
The static library is distributed in this crate with permission from FTDI.

```toml
[dependencies]
libftd2xx-ffi = "~0.4.0"
```

The default feature set will use pre-generated bindings.
This is only available for Windows x86_64 and Linux x86_64 platforms.

The bindings can also be generated during compilation using the [bindgen]
feature flag.
```toml
[dependencies]
libftd2xx-ffi = { version = "~0.4.0", features = ["bindgen"] }
```

Bindgen has additional dependencies that must be installed in order to
compile successfully, see the [bindgen requirements] page for more details.

## Supported Targets

* `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
* `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
* `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`

## Troubleshooting
### Unknown Device on Linux
Remove the VCP FTDI driver.
```bash
sudo rmmod ftdi_sio
sudo rmmod usbserial
```
See [FTDI Drivers Installation Guide for Linux] for more details.

## License
FTDI provides the D2XX driver as a compiled library and a header file.
These files can be found within the `vendor` directory.

The code within the `vendor` directory is licensed by FTDI.
Please see the [Driver License Terms] page for their license.

All code outside of the `vendor` directory is MIT licensed.

## Maintainers Notes
### README Generation
The README file is generated with [cargo-readme].

```bash
cargo install cargo-readme
cargo readme > README.md
```

### Pre-generated Bindings
The pre-generated bindings are generated by compiling this crate, then
copying the `bindings.rs` file from the build output.

The Windows bindings were run through `dos2unix` to normalize line endings
and make it easier to diff the generated bindings.
